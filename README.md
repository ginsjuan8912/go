# Me learning process with GO

Hi all, during all this time I have grown my interest in learning new programming languages. One of my favorites is go, which has a built-in go-rutines and channels feature that I really love.

During this learning process I have been able to:

1. Complete a set of exercise understanding the basics of go.
2. Understand a master the different built-in data structures manage by GO like maps, slices, arrays and more.
3. Learn how to use go-rutines, channels, read and write files, and create an http handler.
4. I was able to complete a tik-tak-toe game as a challenge, using all my previous knowledge.
